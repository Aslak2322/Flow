# Fictional PERN-app for a flowrider with integrated shop and booking system
Final project for the full-stack engineer cours on codecademy.
This is a website of a non-existing flowhouse in Copenhagen. 

## Demonstration of what a flowhouse website in Copenhagen could look like

A flowhouse is a place with a flowrider, which is a place with a surf simulator, where you can buy drinks, foods and chill.
The website therefore integrates a cafe, booking system and a shop where you can buy flowboards and boardshorts and so on. 

## Upload to shop

Upload to the shop through the database. Upload a product name, description, price, image-url to the database and the shop component will render it. 

## Build folder already created and uploaded to render. 

Build command is therefore just npm install.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
